## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:
- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

## AI Chatbot (GPT-5)

This project includes a simple AI chat widget (bottom-left) that proxies requests server-side to the OpenAI Chat Completions API.

Setup:

- Add your OpenAI API key to `.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5-mini
```

- Build frontend assets (using Vite):

```powershell
npm install
npm run build
```

- Or for development with hot reload:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Usage:

- Open the site, click the round chat button at bottom-left, type a message and send. The server will forward messages to the model and return replies in Indonesian by default.

Rate limits and access:

- Authenticated users: 60 requests per minute.
- Guests (not logged in): 10 requests per minute (limited by IP).

Notes & Security:

- The server endpoint `POST /ai/chat` requires a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` and is CSRF-protected.
- Adjust `OPENAI_MODEL` in `.env` to change model (e.g., `gpt-5-mini` or other available model names).
